meituan_restful_api
===================

These works was union of meituan restful api. 
For personal study reason, I put my works here because meituan has changed this api and it has gone out of use. 

These codes was written by myself in several days , and they are my first atempt on nodejs coding . So , it may 
provide some meaningful thoughts to you , although some codes are raw and not pefect . 

It runs sevral months in product environment. After my leaving of the company, no one could(would) maintance it.
And the same function now is achived by PHP with a common way.

These codes are only half of the work, on the other hand , it requires some data stored within mongodb in predefined
format. You should store meituan api in json format with a straight way, and deploy your mongodb properly for running
the codes.

After above, you should install all the nodejs modules required using - npm install ~

Once you finished all these works, you can run it by : node app.js
